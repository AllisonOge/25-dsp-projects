Here is a detailed step-by-step process for removing the background of an image using Python:

1. Install necessary packages: You will need to install some packages to carry out this task. The most popular package for image processing in Python is OpenCV. You can install it using the following command:
```s
pip install opencv-python
```
2. Import necessary packages: Once you have installed the necessary packages, you can import them in your code using the following lines:
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
```
3. Load the image: Next, you need to load the image that you want to process. You can use the following code to load an image:
```python
img = cv2.imread("path/to/image.jpg")
```
Make sure to replace "path/to/image.jpg" with the path to your actual image file.

4. Convert the image to grayscale: In order to process the image, it is best to first convert it to grayscale. This can be done using the following code:
```python
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
```
5. Threshold the image: The next step is to apply a threshold to the image, which will separate the foreground (the object you want to isolate) from the background. You can use the following code to apply a threshold:
```python
_, thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
```
6. Find contours in the image: Once you have applied the threshold, you can use the `cv2.findContours()` function to find the contours in the image. Contours are the boundaries of the foreground object. You can use the following code to find contours:
```python
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
```
7. Find the largest contour: You can use the cv2.contourArea() function to calculate the area of each contour, and then find the largest one. The largest contour is likely to be the foreground object. You can use the following code to find the largest contour:
```python
max_contour = max(contours, key=cv2.contourArea)
```
8. Create a mask: Once you have found the largest contour, you can create a mask from it. A mask is an image where the foreground object is white and the background is black. You can create a mask using the following code:
```python
mask = np.zeros(img.shape[:2], np.uint8)
cv2.drawContours(mask, [max_contour], -1, 255, -1)
```
9. Apply the mask to the image: Finally, you can apply the mask to the original image to remove the background. You can use the following code to apply the mask:
```python
result = cv2.bitwise_and(img, img, mask=mask)
```
The resulting image will have the background removed and only the foreground object remaining.

10. Save the result: Once you have removed the background, you can save the result to a new image file using the following code:
```python
cv2.imwrite("path/to/result.jpg", result)
```
Make sure to replace "path/to/result.jpg" with the path to the location where you want to save the new image file.

That's it! With these steps, you should be able to remove the background of an image using Python.
